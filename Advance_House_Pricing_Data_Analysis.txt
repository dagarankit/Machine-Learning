All the LifeCycle in a data Science Projects

1. Data Analysis  (we can also say it Data Preprocessing)
2. Feature Engineering
3. Feature Selection
4. Model Building
5. Model Deployment

Each and every part of lifecycle is a pipeline like data Analysis can run independently 
whether it is Feature Engineerng etc. then we can link all together.

DATA ANALYSIS

IN DATA ANALYSIS WE WILL ANALYZE TO FIND OUT BELOW STUFF----

1. Missing values
2. All the Numerical Variables
3. Distribution of Numerical Variables -- Regression part
4. Categorical Variables
5. Cardinality of Categorical Variables
6. Outliers
7. Relationship between independent and dependent feature (Sales Price)




whenever we want to solve a regression problem we need to make a Non Gaussian Distribution
to Gaussian Distribution or Standard Normal Distribution
